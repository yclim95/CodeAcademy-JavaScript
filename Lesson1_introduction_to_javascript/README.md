#Lesson1 Introduction To Javascript
## Getting Started with Programming 

### 1. Length (String)
To discover the length of your name write your name within quotes. Then write a period (full stop) and the word length like this:

```javascript
"yourName".length;
```

### 2. Basic Maths 

**Less Numbers**
```javascript
3+4;
```

**More Numbers**
```javascript
3*5/5;
```

### 3. Comments 
```javascript
// This is a comment that the computer will ignore. 
// It is for your eyes only!
```

The `//` sign is for comments. A comment is a line of text that JavaScript won't try to run as code. It's just for humans to read.
